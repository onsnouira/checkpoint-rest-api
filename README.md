Project Name :REST-API
In this mini project, you will be performing a series of guided instructions to create a REST API by manipulating your database with Mongoose.
Instructions :  1-Install the required dependencies: mongoose, express, and dotenv.
                2-Launch a server with Express in the server.js file.
                3-Connect your database with MongoDB Atlas.
                4-Create a models folder and a User.js file in it.
                5-In User.js, define a Mongoose Schema and export the model. You will use it in server.js.
                6-In server.js, create four routes:

                                              *GET: Return all users.
                                              *POST: Add a new user to the database.
                                              *PUT: Edit a user by ID.
                                              *DELETE: Remove a user by ID.
                7-Use Postman to test each route.
